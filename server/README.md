# Typescript Template
This is a template for the **TypeScript** projects. You can install it easily and start coding right away.

## Important
I recommend to use **yarn** instead of **npm** because **yarn** faster.<br>[**Click here**](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you want to get more information about yarn.

## Installation
```
yarn install
```

## Scripts
- `yarn clean` **➜** *Deletes the **dist** folder*
- `yarn build` **➜** *Builds the project*
- `yarn start` **➜** *Stars the project* **(You must build the project before starting)**
- `yarn dev` **➜** *Starts the project as dev*
